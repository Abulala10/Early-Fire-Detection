# Early-Fire-Detection

# Introduction
	Fire breakouts pose a serious threat to life, damaging large acres of forest and even infrastructures. These fire breakouts can be potentially evaded to minimize the overall damage by predicting them well in advance. This early detection can then be used to take the necessary actions to alleviate the situation. The proposed system will involve early fire detection that can be implemented by placing integrated cameras in fire prone areas including huge infrastructures and public places and using machine learning algorithm to predict whether there will be a fire breakout or not. 
	Early detection and prediction of fires results in lesser damage to resources and improved firefighting response. This will also lead to reducing and efficiently using the costs involved in disaster management. The same model can be applied to schools, hospitals, buildings and other infrastructures that are prone to recurrent fire breakouts.

# Aim and Objectives of Project
The aim of this project is to promptly detect fire through the use of integrated cameras and Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) machine learning algorithm, inform fire patrol parties and send them the location of the fire to control it.

# Problem statement
	Implementation of a fire detection system using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) machine learning algorithm which predicts the output based on the preloaded data. The data is divided into two sets i.e., training and testing data. The training data consists of a huge number of inputs. After a model is trained using training data then it has been tested using the testing data (less data).
